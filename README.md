# Lift ðŸ’ª (WiP)

## Project description

I do powerlifting workouts and follow a program with a monthly cycle. I've been looking for an easy way to calculate my progression for the monthly cycles, but have found that most apps have minor nuisances. Therefore, I've been trying to build my own progression tracker, tailored just to my needs.

## Technologies

This is a project was built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).\
To enhance the CSS writing experience, I'm using the [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) pre-processor.\
For UI components I'm using [Naive UI](https://www.naiveui.com/en-US/os-theme)

## Installation

After cloning the repo, run the project locally by using npm:

```
$ cd your-repo
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
